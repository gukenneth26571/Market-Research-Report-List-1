<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Topical Pain Relief Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Opioids</li><li>Opioids</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The topical pain relief market consists of two primary categories: non-opioids and opioids. Non-opioid products, such as NSAIDs and lidocaine patches, provide pain relief by targeting inflammation and numbing a localized area without central nervous system effects.
