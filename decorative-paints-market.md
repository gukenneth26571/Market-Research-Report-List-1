<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Decorative Paints Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent-based</li><li>Water-based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The decorative paints market is primarily divided into two types: solvent-based and water-based paints. Solvent-based paints utilize organic solvents for their consistency, offering durability and resistance to wear, making them suitable for exterior applications. However, they often emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In contrast, water-based paints use water as a solvent, providing easier cleanup and lower VOC emissions, making them more environmentally friendly. Water-based paints are commonly preferred for interior spaces due to their quick-drying properties and reduced odor.</p></p>
