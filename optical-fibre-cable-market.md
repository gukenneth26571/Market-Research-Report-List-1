<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Fibre Cable Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Mode Fiber</li><li>Multimode Fiber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The optical fiber cable market is primarily divided into two types: single mode fiber and multimode fiber. Single mode fiber has a small core diameter, allowing only one light mode to propagate, which results in higher bandwidth and longer transmission distances, making it ideal for long-distance communication. In contrast, multimode fiber has a larger core, permitting multiple light modes, which facilitates shorter distances and higher data rates for local area networks. Both types cater to specific applications in telecommunications, data centers, and enterprise networks.</p></p>
