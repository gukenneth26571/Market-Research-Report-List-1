<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heavy Axles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Drive Axles</li><li>Non-Driven Axles</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heavy axles market comprises two primary types: drive axles and non-driven axles. Drive axles are responsible for transferring power from the vehicle's engine to the wheels, enabling motion and handling heavy loads, making them essential for trucks and heavy machinery. Non-driven axles, on the other hand, do not receive power and are mainly used for support and stability, often found in trailers and non-powered vehicles. Both types are crucial for optimizing vehicle performance and load-bearing capacity.</p></p>
